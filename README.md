# Brew Crew Flutter App

This project is the result of a tutorial provided on Youtube by The Net Ninja on Flutter + Firebase:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfA3NWDBPZ4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC

Watch the last video in the series to see how this App behaves.

The tutor provides his own implementation in the following repository:

* https://github.com/iamshaunjp/flutter-firebase

However, the project in the present repository uses the latest dependencies (see commit dates) rather than the ones proposed in the lessons.
Therefore, the implementation differs slightly.

Furthermore, additional features might be added over time.
To have an overview of what has been implemented, see Tags.

## Configuration

This app requires Google Firebase and Firestore.
To understand how to set them up, watch the first two videos from the Youtube series above.
